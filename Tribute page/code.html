    <h2><strong>One of the famous quotes by Srinivasa Ramanujan is:-</strong></h2>

              <h3><blockquote><strong>"An equation means nothing to me unless it expresses a thought of God."</strong></blockquote></h3>
This quote highlights Ramanujan's deep spiritual and philosophical beliefs and how they influenced his mathematical work. He believed that mathematics was not just a human invention, but rather a divine language that could reveal profound truths about the universe
